# **Web Vulnerability Scanner**

This project involves developing a web vulnerability scanner that detects common web security issues such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities. The scanner also retrieves CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) scores for known vulnerabilities to assess their severity.

## **Features:**

- **Web Application Risk Assessment:** a security analyst, I want to identify common vulnerabilities in web applications to assess their risk.
- **Web Application Vulnerability Check:** As an IT manager, I want to understand the severity of detected vulnerabilities through CVSS scores.
- **Web Application Security Check:** as a developer, I want to ensure that the web application is free of common vulnerabilities.
- **Detailed Scan Results:** Presents detailed information about the scan results.

## **Technologies Used:**

- **Python:** Programming language for developing the scanner
- **Web Application for Testing:** A sample web application or test URL.
Kali Linux Virtual machine
- **Libraries and Tools:** requests, BeautifulSoup, urllib3

## **Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.x 
- Kali VM

## **Usage:**

**Save the Python Script:**

 - Navigate to the Kali Linux VM terminal and paste the script on the terminal then save the script by running `nano script_name.py`.

**Initiate a Web Vulnerability Scan:**

 - For demostration running the command `python3 web_vul.py http://testphp.vulnweb.com` on a Kali VM terminal would likely initiate a web vulnerability scan on the specified URL http://testphp.vulnweb.com. This scan aims to identify potential security weaknesses, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common vulnerabilities.

**View Scan Results:**

> - **SQL Injection Detection:** Successfully identified SQL Injection vulnerabilities and displayed relevant information.
> - **XSS Detection:** Successfully detected XSS vulnerabilities and displayed relevant information.
> - **CSRF Detection:** Successfully identified CSRF vulnerabilities and provided details.
> - **CVSS Score Retrieval:** Accurately retrieved and displayed CVSS scores for known vulnerabilities.

## **Test Plan:**

- **Unit Testing:** Test each vulnerability detection method (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF).
- **Integration Testing:** Test the overall scanner with a known vulnerable web application.
- **User Acceptance Testing:** Verify that the CVSS scores are accurately retrieved and reported.
